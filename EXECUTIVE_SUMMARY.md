## Executive Summary

- The Aadhaar ecosystem generates extensive enrolment and update data across regions, age groups, and time periods, reflecting how identity services are accessed nationwide. While this data is rich in information, systematic analysis of patterns, trends, and variations is essential to support informed operational planning and service improvement.

- This study analyses Aadhaar-related activity data with a primary focus on **age-wise biometric activity**, while using enrolment and demographic datasets for contextual understanding. The analysis examines biometric demand across temporal and geographic dimensions to identify recurring patterns, regional concentration, and periods of demand fluctuation.

- Key findings indicate that biometric demand varies significantly across **age groups, regions, and time**. Activity is unevenly distributed geographically, with certain districts consistently contributing a higher share of demand. Temporal analysis reveals a combination of stable demand patterns and short-term spikes, indicating that service requirements are neither uniform nor constant.

- Age-wise analysis further shows that biometric demand composition differs across regions, highlighting the importance of **age-aware service planning** rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

- Based on these insights, the study proposes **data-driven improvement opportunities** that do not require major system changes. These include:
  - Demand-aligned capacity planning  
  - Adoption of a hybrid service delivery model combining permanent centres, pop-up locations, and mobile units  
  - Age-aware planning strategies  
  - Proactive preparation for temporal demand variations  

- Collectively, these measures can improve infrastructure utilisation, reduce congestion, and enhance overall citizen experience.

- Overall, this analysis demonstrates how existing Aadhaar data can be leveraged to support **more flexible, efficient, and responsive service planning**, enabling incremental improvements in Aadhaar service delivery through informed decision-making.
